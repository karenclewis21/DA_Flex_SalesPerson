1. Who was the top salesperson for the year?


2. How much better did the top salesperson do than the individual who came in second for the year?


3. Was there any relationship between the average sale amount for the top salespersons and the total sales?


4. How do you think the top selling salesperson gained so many sales? What was their strategy?

- Did they sell to many customers, or a dedicated few?
- Did they tend to sell a few big ticket (high priced) items, or did they focus on a high volume of lower priced items?

 

5. What was the top selling product for the year? What was the lowest selling? (For both dollar amount sold and quantity sold).


6. What problems did you find in the data? (For example, where there any products without a price?)
